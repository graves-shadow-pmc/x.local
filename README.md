## 🌐 What is MeshMap Social?

## 🚀 What Can MeshMap Social Do?

### 🟢 **Key Features**

- **Decentralized Mesh Networking:**  
  Connect directly to people nearby via Bluetooth, WiFi Direct, and peer-to-peer protocols. No central server—so the network can’t be shut down.

- **Context-Aware Interactions:**  
  The app uses on-device AI to understand your intentions and needs, surfacing relevant posts, people, and opportunities wherever you are.

- **Hyper-Local Discovery & Safety:**  
  Find others, gigs, help, and important alerts within your current “zone” (venue, event, neighborhood) in real time—even offline.

- **Privacy by Default:**  
  No forced sign-ups, no data harvesting, and all sharing is opt-in. You’re always in control of your identity and data.

- **Instant Emergency & Help Alerts:**  
  Broadcast requests for help, lost items, or emergencies to everyone nearby—get faster, safer responses.

- **Optional Cloud Sync:**  
  If you choose, securely back up your connections and activity using open cloud (Firebase). Everything works without it.

- **Community-Driven and Forkable:**  
  Anyone can fork, rebrand, and boot up their own mesh social network—unstoppable, open, and resilient.

- **Reduces Digital Divide:**  
  Works offline via mesh and peer-to-peer, helping connect those without reliable internet.

  Entirely open source and community-owned. Fork, improve, or adapt for your local needs.
